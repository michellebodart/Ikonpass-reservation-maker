# Ikonpass-reservation-maker
Automatic Ikonpass ski resort reservation maker.
Still a work in progress

For this to work, you need Selenium installed as well as either webdriver_manager or manually install the webdriver

* Update: For the 2021-2022 ski season, the Ikonpass website has begun to require users to pass a ReCAPTCHA to make reservations when using an automated system such as this. This bot is not sophisticated enough to pass the ReCaptcha, and therefore is no longer useful. I'm grateful for all of the reservations this bot got me last season, and I'd like to think that this is part of the reason that Ikon implemented a ReCAPTCHA check this season.
